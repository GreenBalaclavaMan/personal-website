          I can use HTML, PHP, and SQL, to make fairly complex web solutions. This means that anything from a simple website like this one, to a social media website involving thousands of users and a complex database, are both within my abilities.

          One of my favourite web projects I've developed is <a href="https://webotp.nicholasrinella.com">an open source text encryption tool</a>.
     </p>
     <p>
          I have also done some freelance web development, which has given me even more experience in the field.
